For the Java projects contained in this repository, please consider the following prerequisites
  * Java JDK 1.8.x latest (was tested only with a JDK and not with a JRE)
  * Eclipse 4.6.x latest (m2e - Maven for Eclipse - must be contained)
  * For building on the commandline use Apache Maven 3.x (latest) 
 
## Create XSLTs from Schematrons
  
Invoke `mvn -f pom-xslt.xml process-resources` after changes - it will regenerate the XSLTs from the source SCHs.
Don't forget to update the license headers afterwards (see below).
 
## Check if the examples files match the rules from the XSLTs
  
Invoke `mvn -f pom-validate.xml validate` after re-creating the XSLTs (see above).
 
## Update the license headers

The template for the license header resides in the file `templates/license-template.txt`.
To add the license header to all relevant files invoke the following command:

```
mvn -f pom-license.xml license:format
```
